  "body": "### Pixiedust!\r\n`pixiedust` is an R package for producing complete, publication-ready tables for statistical analyses.  It is designed to give the user the ability to fine tune each individual cell of a table while keeping as much of the code of the rendering language in the background as possible.  \r\n\r\nDetailed explanations of `pixiedust` options are provided on this website.  In time, it will host examples for all of the output types supported by `pixiedust`, including console output, markdown, HTML, and LaTeX.\r\n\r\n### Why Pixiedust?\r\nThere is nothing in my professional career that has caused me more angst than trying to format results from statistical analyses into attractive, presentable, and readable tables that my clients can interpret.  This was especially true with respect to summarizing statistical models.  For most of the analyses I did, I'd eventually cobble together some hack that did what I wanted, but it inevitably failed me, or didn't provide the flexibility I needed for special circumstances.  Or worse, required me to do all manner of ugly post-processing manipulations to get the look I wanted.\r\n\r\nOne day, I said to myself in frustration, \"why can't we just build tables like plots are built in `ggplot`?\"  It occurred to me then that what I had been doing wrong was that I was trying to pass an object to a single function and have one function that did everything I wanted it to do.  Instead, I needed an object that could be acted upon through several functions.  This inspiration, pushed along by the introduction of the `broom` package, gave birth to `pixiedust`.  \r\n\r\nThe name `pixiedust` was chosen because I liked the imagery of sprinkling a table cell with dust and magically changing it's appearance. So far, `pixiedust` has been a success, at least in my work.  It has avoided many of the frustrations my earlier attempts have encountered; and the few shortcomings I have found have been easily remedied.  I hope it works for you, too.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have questions about `pixiedust` or difficulties using it, please [file an issue](https://github.com/nutterb/pixiedust/issues) or send an e-mail to nutter@battelle.org.  Feature requests and suggested code improvements are always welcome.\r\n",
